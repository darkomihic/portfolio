    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Last-year student at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, eager to expand my knowledge in software development. 
      I am particularly interested in building information systems, exploring different web technologies, and modeling databases. 
      I am flexible, a strong team player, and equally effective working independently. 
      I also have experience working remotely and thrive in environments with motivated colleagues and experienced mentors for professional growth.
